## ðŸ˜­ Do you have the following pain points in daily development?

- There is no special operation and maintenance in the team, and the development needs to do the operation and maintenance work, and you need to manually build and deploy the project yourself.
- Different projects have different build and deploy commands.
- There are requirements for multi-environment packaging such as development, testing, and production.
- Need to monitor the running status of multiple projects at the same time.
- You need to download the SSH tool to connect to the server remotely.
- Need to download FTP tool to transfer files to server.
- When there are multiple servers, it is inconvenient to synchronize account passwords between different computers.
- I want to use some automation tools, but the performance of the server is too high and it is too troublesome to build.
- I have individual needs for automation tools and want to modify the project myself, but the tools on the market are too complicated.
